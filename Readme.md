## Abstract

This repository will hold the code developed while writing on my blog [post](https://blog.tekcookie75.net/2024-10-03-Infrastructure-as-Code-gitea-meets-coreOS/) about Infrastructure as Code. Within this post, I demonstrate in a proof of concept manner how you can create your own descriptive model of an infrastructure hosting a basic [gitea](https://about.gitea.com/). The model is build using [Fedora CoreOS](https://fedoraproject.org/coreos/) and `podman`.  For a complete reference of the usage of this code, pleas refer to the blog [post](https://blog.tekcookie75.net/2024-10-03-Infrastructure-as-Code-gitea-meets-coreOS/).
